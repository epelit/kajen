This is a submission for APRICOT 2023 Hackathon for Team KAJEN.

The tool was created for team KAJEN and the main purpose is to measure and analyze IPV4 and IPV6 route symmetry to ccTLD using dual stack ATLAS RIPE probes.

The shell script reads country ccTLD from a file, fetches the Authoritative Name Servers and writes these items to a file.

Using the ripe atlas command line tools and application program interface (API) you can fetch the dual stack probes in a certain location.

A PHP script will then fetch measurements from RIPE ATLAS (ping and traceroute) to ccTLD name servers and generate a table.

NOTE: The measurements were created using the UI (https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements) but can be scripted if you have appropriate key and permissions.
